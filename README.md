# ilmeteo_scraper
This is a small code that retrieve historical weather data from the Italian website Ilmeteo.it
Not every location will have historical data so expect to don't get each city results.

TODO:
- Fix search of cities with special characters such as "L'Aquila"
- Keep track of cities not found so that you don't have to manually look for the missing locations.
